If you have something to ask, **please JUST ASK instead of asking if you
can ask or if someone can help or if anyone is there**.

Servers
-------

Most IRCnet servers aren't open for everyone, so if you're having trouble
finding one, use open.ircnet.net which resolves to a number of open IRCnet
servers that you should be able to use.

For EFNet, use `irc.efnet.net`. Most countries have an `irc.efnet.TLD`.
