If your irssi crashes, it's always a bug. Please read [bugreporting howto](/documentation/crash)
and send one. For other type of bugs, it would still be nice to hear of them,
but chances are that it's already known. Send all bugreports to irssi's [bug
reporting system](//github.com/irssi/irssi/issues), but check if it has already
been reported first.

Compiling problems
------------------

Read the INSTALL file that comes with irssi, it explains the most common
problems.

Still problems?
---------------

Read the [FAQ](/documentation/faq)
before asking anything.
The [Startup How-To](/documentation/startup) is quite useful as well.
And if you just want to know about some setting, you could very well guess
it yourself too, like if you want to change something related to windows,
try `/SET window`.

If you still haven't found what you're looking for, and googling didn't help either,
try asking on IRC in `#irssi`.
