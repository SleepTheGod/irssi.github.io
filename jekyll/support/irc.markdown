Official international channel
-------------------------------

- \#irssi at [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) -- English only

To join, `/connect -tls_verify irc.libera.chat`, then `/join #irssi`

If you have trouble getting Irssi to work, you can use a
[webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#ircs://irc.libera.chat/#irssi)
in the meantime.

Other channels
--------------

Many other networks like IRCnet, EFNet or QuakeNet also have `#irssi` channels.

There may be some international channels on IRCnet, like

- \#irssi.fi -- Finnish
- \#irssi.de -- German
- \#irssi.pl -- Polish

If you have something to ask, **please JUST ASK instead of asking if you
can ask or if someone can help or if anyone is there**.

Servers
-------

To connect with Libera.Chat, `/connect -tls_verify irc.libera.chat` or on
Irssi 1.3 or later `/connect liberachat`

Most IRCnet servers aren't open for everyone, so if you're having trouble
finding one, use open.ircnet.net which resolves to a number of open IRCnet
servers that you should be able to use.

For EFNet, use `irc.efnet.org`, or check their website for more servers.
