Due to a bug in the [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/) autoconf package we decided to release
a new source-package generated on a [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) system.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previously released version. Please bear in mind that
this release does NOT include any new features or code-changes. It's just a re-packaged source.

If you have problems compiling Irssi due to autoconf or ./configure errors, please go to
[the download section](http://www.irssi.org/download) and give the re-packaged source a shot.

The Irssi Team
