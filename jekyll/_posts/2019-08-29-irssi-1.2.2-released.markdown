title: "Irssi 1.2.2 Released"
---

Irssi 1.2.2 has been released! It contains some critical updates which
we hope you'll enjoy. There are no new features. **All Irssi 1.2 users
should upgrade to this version**. See the [NEWS](/NEWS/#v1-2-2) for
details.

For more information refer to the [security
advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2019_08).

If you've had any issues with Irssi crashing right on start,
hopefully this update will fix that.

This release can be downloaded from [our releases page](/NEWS). Binary
test packages for various Linux distributions are automatically
generated by the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/)
and are available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

The Irssi Team.
