title: "Funny Irssi theme!"

Today when I opened my mail client I was surprised by a "new 
theme", I looked at it and saw a GTK2 Java development IDE which some 
interesting Irssi/IRC embedded into it. {% include img_link.html src="//irssi-import.github.io/themes/thumb/t_c0ders.png" link="//irssi-import.github.io/themes/c0ders.png" alt="[Screenshot]" %}

I have to admit that this is the most funniest 
Irssi theme I've seen so far. It's amazing what people can do to reach 
their goals (or to hide their client @ work :p).

The [c0ders theme](//irssi-import.github.io/themes/c0ders.theme) has been added to [the themes page](/themes). We will add the other submitted scripts and themes when we start working with [Google's Summer of Code]({% post_url historical/2006-04-20-irssi-and-the-summer-of-code %}).
