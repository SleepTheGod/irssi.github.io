Irssi 1.4.5 has been released!

Includes the following fixes:

- Fix for Perl scripts not working on Perl 5.37 or later
- Workaround for Perl 5.38.0 breaking the program locale and rendering of some unicode characters
- Document some workarounds for building with meson on Apple (see [INSTALL](https://codeberg.org/irssi/irssi/src/tag/1.4.5/INSTALL#L149))

If you are not affected by these issues, the update is not strictly necessary.
