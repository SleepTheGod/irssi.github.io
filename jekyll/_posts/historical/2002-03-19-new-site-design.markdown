Got a pretty logo from [Zenmasta](http://www.pp.htv.fi/jfiner/) today
and while trying to add it here, I thought I'd finally rewrite the whole
site. This should be at least easier for new people since it's not
filled with links. So far received some positive and some negative
feedback, but all new site designs seem to do that ;)
