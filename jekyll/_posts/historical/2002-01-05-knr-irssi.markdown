Just spent a few hours checking if irssi's sources could be ported to
K&R easily. After finding
[proto](http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/proto/proto.html), it was quite
easy, but required some modifications. glib.h especially needed manual
changes. Anyway, if you're interested in trying it, get the sources
here: \</files/misc/irssi-kr-20020104.tar.gz\>. I compiled it
succesfully with HP-UX 11.0's cc, there's a hpux-build script included
which you probably want to look at even without HP-UX.
