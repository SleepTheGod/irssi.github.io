Now that I **finally** found the bug that had been crashing my irssi,
0.7.99 will be soon out. It was solaris-specific (as in, not at least
linux :) actually, but I had been doing some major changes to irssi
while moving to IRC from solaris box, so I didn't see the connection.
Luckily I found and fixed several other bugs that had been crashing
irssi as well.

Anyway, unless I see my irssi crash before next weekend, 0.7.99 will be
out then. Now's a good time to go grab [latest development
snapshot](/download) and see if there's any bugs left. I'd at least need
to create some /STATUSBAR command so users don't need to edit the config
file manually..
