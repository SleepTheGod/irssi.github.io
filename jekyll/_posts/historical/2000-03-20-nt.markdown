Yet another bug that affected new Irssi users, the default config file
was broken.. Get a new one here: \</files/config\> and place it to
irssi's source dir and recompile. Version 0.7.28-3 tarball also fixes
this.

I've also been cleaning up irssi's sources **a lot** and merging i2k's
code to it. I'll try to release a new clean version next weekend :)
