Yet another remote crash found. I'm getting tired of this. There's a few
good things in irssi's code, and I'm still quite sure there's no (write)
buffer overflows, but most of it is getting a big mess. I think the next
thing I will do is rewrite the whole crap. Though imapd comes first - I
need to do something else than irssi for a while.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure this is the last remote crash that can be found
from 0.8.x, there's only few potential places and I've looked most of
them through already.

Also, this release is the same as 0.8.4 with only the crash fixed, I
didn't trust enough the current CVS code to release it as 0.8.5.
