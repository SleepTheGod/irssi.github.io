Irssi 0.7.26 released. This one will be the final, I promise ;) There's
only one bugfix, space didn't work with GTK version if numlock/capslock
was on. You can also get the diff to 0.7.25
here: \</files/irssi-0.7.26.diff\>. Apply it with *cd
.../irssi-0.7.25/src/gui-gnome; patch \< irssi-0.7.26.diff*
