Hmh, again too much time has passed without much work being done. I
guess the yet another reorganizing of code for adding of SILC support
easier didn't do good for me. The code is mostly good but with a couple
of ugly kludges. Perl support has also been broken for many weeks in CVS
.. if I only could fix it I could release new version.

But then some good news - I just spent 2 hours of writing
**documentation** for irssi newbies (guess I finally got tired of
explaining the same basic things for each new Irssi user). [Get the
Startup-HOWTO here](/documentation/startup/).
