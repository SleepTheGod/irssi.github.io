First version of GtkIText is now in CVS. Summary of it's features:

  - Proportional fonts
  - It's fast - or at least I don't know how to make it any more faster
  - When text is split to next line, it leaves some space before the
    text. The amount of space will be the space used by nick in future.
  - It will have graphics support :)

Currently you can't select/copy text from it and /clear doesn't work
either. You also can't select font or background..
