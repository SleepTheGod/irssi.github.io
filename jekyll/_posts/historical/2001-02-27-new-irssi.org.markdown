Learned CSS and did irssi.org fully with it without any horrible tables
or other netscape kludges this time. Netscape has its own specific page
done with tables. There's Lynx specific page too. I've tried this page
with Mozilla .8, Konqueror, Netscape, Lynx, Links, w3m and IE 5.0. Bug
reports, suggestions, general complains, etc. all welcome :)
