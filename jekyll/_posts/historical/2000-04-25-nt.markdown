It's amazing how much you can do when there's no IRC you spend your time
on. For example, you could code an IRC client 4 days in a row
interrupted only by some sleep, 10 hours of x-files and few other tv
shows :)

So, I would have put the changelog here, but I forgot the disk to home
:( I'll put it here tomorrow. There are **LOTS** of new really advanced
features that I don't think many clients have (for example regexp
support in several places, a lot better logging and notifylist notifies
of away and idle changes). And there's a lot of EPIC-compatibility, I
did it in as many places I could (and had time to), except where I could
do better and break the epic syntax because of it. I'm not sure about
it's scripting and /ON command, maybe.. as a separate module.

I also quit my job today, an hour ago :) New place will be at
[springtoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_gaming_in_Finland), as
a game developer. That's a great place to work for, even while I'm not
very enthusiastic about games.
