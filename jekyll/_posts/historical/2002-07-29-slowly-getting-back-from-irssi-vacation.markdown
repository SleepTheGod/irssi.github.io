For the past two months I've been pretty unresponsive about anything
related to irssi, still 37 unread/answered mails in my inbox.. Anyway,
now that my new, great and secure [IMAP server](https://dovecot.org/) is
beginning to be usable, I'll try to get back to coding irssi and reading
\#irssi channels more actively :) Most likely I'll just continue with
irssi's rewrite, as the 0.8 sources look quite horrible after getting
used to seeing the new imapd code ([temporary memory
pools](https://wiki.dovecot.org/Design/Memory) especially).
