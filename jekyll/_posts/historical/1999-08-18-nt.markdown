Just released irssi 0.7.14 alpha-3. I've removed my horribly slow
configuration file routines (well, gnome version was still fast..) and
replaced them with libPropList. This means that configuration file
format is completely different now, and I had to change quite a lot of
code to make it work.. So, could try if this alpha versions works
properly so I could release the final 0.7.14? :)

Get the irssi alpha [here](/download), and libPropList from download
page (..or apt-get install libproplist0-dev).
