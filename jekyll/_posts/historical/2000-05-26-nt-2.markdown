FINALLY - I got internet to home :) Took only 2 weeks actually, even
while they told it would take 3-4 months. It's a cable modem, hopefully
works well where I live .. will see, it should work today/tomorrow. I
was pretty desperate at some times actually :) I almost took a normal
56k modem but phone lines cost **too** much here, about 1/3 of what ADSL
would cost. But ADSL and the rest had mostly 2 months of delivery time..
And the "free" internet that I was supposed to get .. well, don't know,
those people are too busy, maybe I will still get it.

And irssi - there's a few big things that need to be done (dcc chat) and
lots of smaller things until I could get some release out. Maybe it will
speed up now that I can IRC from home too :) I have also been doing
botnet for irssi, will try to replace those eggdrops with it some day :)
