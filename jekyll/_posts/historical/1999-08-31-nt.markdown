Released 0.7.15-3, which will finally fix all those bugs .15 and .15-2
sufferend. I've learned my lesson, never release software without
testing it first well enough even how much you want to release it
immediately :)

.15-3 has also a rawlog window which you can use to check what's going
on in server connection. Also great for debugging.

I also released .15-2 -\> .15-3 patch: \</files/irssi.diff.bz2\>. To
apply it go to irssi's directory and run  
*cat \~/irssi.diff.bz2 | bunzip2 | patch -p1*

If you applied any older patches, answer no to questions about applying
reverted patches..
