I don't think I'll be updating irssi for a while (except maybe
bugfixes..). I'm actually pretty much got bored of doing it. However,
I'm sure the i2k will come some day :) Maybe soon (Q1 of '00 even? :)
and probably with different name. I'll put updates about it here.

Plans about i2k .. well, I'm going to concentrate more into the text
version of it .. maybe we'll finally get ircii killer? :) ircii sources
are IMHO pretty horrible so it shouldn't be too hard job ;) I thought
about making it as epic much compatible as possible, maybe even be able
to run epic scripts. And I'll do the scripting (epic, perl, python, ..)
support as plugins, so if you don't need epic (or whatever) scripting
support, you just don't load the plugin. Only minor drawback of this
would be that everyone will create scripts with different languages and
soon you would need to load all of the plugins anyway... Anyway, the
goal is to make it faster, eat less memory, have a lot more
understandable sources and be a lot easier to write expansions without
needing to add lots of bloat to the main binary (like bitchx) than ircii
(based clients).

After I get this done I'll start thinking of GTK/GNOME/KDE (probably not
plain QT :) frontends.
