I've been rewriting irssi for some time now. It's not a full rewrite but
rather I'll just change things bit by bit and eventually it will have
quite a lot of things changed. A few things that will change are getting
rid of GLib, getting rid of the excessive dynamic memory allocations and
in general making code prettier :)

I've also been thinking that now would be the time to think of the
bigger changes as well. First thing I just thought of was making themes
a lot more powerful than before - this would require internal scripting
but maybe it's not THAT bad to have it.. Anyway, [read all about
here](/historical/themes.txt). If you have been thinking of some great
new feature, now's the time to tell me about it :)
