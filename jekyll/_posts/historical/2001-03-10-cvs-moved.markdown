Now in same computer as the rest of the irssi.org. New CVSROOT is
*:pserver:anonymous@cvs.irssi.org:/home/cvs*. Easiest way to change the
existing CVS tree is to update the CVS/Root files, run this in irssi's
root directory:

    echo ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.irssi.org:/home/cvs" > CVS/Root
    find . -name 'Root' -exec cp -f CVS/Root {} \;

**UPDATE:** Sorry, anoncvs seems to be broken now, hopefully fixed soon
:) **UPDATE:** Fixed now :)
