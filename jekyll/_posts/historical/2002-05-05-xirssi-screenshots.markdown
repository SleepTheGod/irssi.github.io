Here's some [preliminary screenshots](/historical/screenshots) for
people :) More features will come, and sometimes after GTK 2.0.3 release
(which is required unless you want to see tons of warnings and possibly
crashing) I'll see if it's ready to be released along with 0.8.5 irssi.
Of course, you can already get it from [CVS](https://github.com/irssi).

UPDATE: xirssi is quite crashy with GTK+ 2.0.2, if you really wish to
use it before GTK+ 2.0.3 is released, you could patch it
yourself: \</files/ext/gtktextlayout.patch\>, or install patched
debian package: \</files/ext/libgtk2.0-0_2.0.2-4_i386.deb\>.
