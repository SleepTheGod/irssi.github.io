I'm planning on replacing the current text formats with separating the
actual texts and coloring. The new formats will look better and are
easier to change.
[Here](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/blob/master/themes/default.theme)
is an example of the new default theme, comments are welcome :) And
thanks to suo for the idea/design.
