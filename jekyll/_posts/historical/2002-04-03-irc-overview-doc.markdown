Wrote a small overview of how irc+ networks would work (with pictures\!
:). It's a bit different from the previous design. See the [projects
page](/historical/projects). Both positive and negative feedback
appreciated :) Especially if you have ideas how exactly to implement
things (especially crypto and routing).
