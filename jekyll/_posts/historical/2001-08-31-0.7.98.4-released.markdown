So, the first remote crash was found (isn't exploitable). Go upgrade to
0.7.98.4, or try the CVS version which should mostly work better than
.98.4. Thanks for Snakeladder/OPN \#irssi for noticing :)

UPDATE: 0.7.98.4 is pretty much the same as 0.7.98.3, except fixes this
remote crash (well, and contains one small fix too). So those of you who
user CVS, or nightly CVS snaphots should just cvs update / get new
nightly CVS snapshot. 0.7.99 will be released when I have time to fix
those few nasty bugs in it..
