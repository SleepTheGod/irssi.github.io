Still some nasty bugs left in .98 series. Themes cannot have highascii
characters (green.theme is broken) and themes must have "replaces = {
};" block specified. Guess I'll fix these and several others and release
.98.4 :) It may take a while though, in the mean time you can go
download one of the daily development versions which are working again
(the box in right).
