Continuing the bugfix release tradition.. ;) Updates are: own dcc
messages were printed to status window, crashes fixed with linux/powerpc
(probably could have happened with some other non-gcc/non-x86
platforms), tab completion in query was buggy: if there was no other
completion choices, word was replaced with queried nick's name. Also
includes updated Brazilian Portuguese translation. Either get the full
tarball or apply the patch: \</files/irssi-0.7.97.1.patch\> *(patch
-p0 irssi-0.7.97.1.patch)*
