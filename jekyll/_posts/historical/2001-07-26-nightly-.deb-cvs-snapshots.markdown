For all you debian users:

``` 
  echo "deb https://irssi.org/debian/ unstable/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  echo "deb-src https://irssi.org/debian/ unstable/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  apt-get update
  apt-get install irssi-text
```

Debian testing (woody) users can replace the *unstable* text with
*testing*. If you wish to provide non-i386 .debs, contact me. Potato
snapshots will come after I get my 386 ready for it :) And add those **/
chars** at the end of debian/ and unstable/ - they're **required**.

You can also download them directly from [here](/download).
