New features include paste detection to allow easily pasting eg. TABs
and to avoid accidentally copy&pasting 20 lines to some channel (both
can be disabled of course), SSL certificate support by Joel Eriksson,
DCC SERVER support by Mark Trumbull, support for DCCing files larger
than 2GB, better DCC transfer statistics, and lots of smaller things.

(0.8.8 was released just an hour after 0.8.7 to fix a few backwards compatibility issues)
