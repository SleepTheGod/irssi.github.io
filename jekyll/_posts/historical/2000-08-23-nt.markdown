Grr. We too have a remote crash bug. No, not a buffer overflow, we don't
have them ;) And not the %s bug, but just some special case. It's not
possible to make it run any arbitrary code, it can only crash irssi.
This affects all 0.7.9x versions. You can get the patch
here: \</files/crashfix.patch\> or get the whole 0.7.95-3 tarball.
Updated .debs and .rpms would be nice to have soon :) UPDATE: .deb is
now updated (version 0.7.95-2).
