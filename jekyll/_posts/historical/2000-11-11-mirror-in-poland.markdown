We now have the first irssi.org mirror in
http://irssi.lubin.eu.org/.
I'll try to make www.pl.irssi.org work soon too. irssi.org is now in CVS
(irssi.org module), if anyone else wants to mirror it then go ahead and
send me note about it and I'll add it to mirrors list. The size is about
1M + 20M of old irssi tarballs which you don't necessarily need if you
just can get rid of them ;) .cvsignore might help.
