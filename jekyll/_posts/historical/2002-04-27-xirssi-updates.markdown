I think it's getting into usable state now. You can get it [from
CVS](https://github.com/irssi). Currently supported features: multiple
windows, tabs and split windows. Supports and uses all the same keyboard
bindings as irssi-text. Moving mouse over nick (in text window or
nicklist) shows it's info in statusbar, right-clicking nick brings popup
menu. That's pretty much it for now - there's no IRC-specific code so
SILC plugin should work with it as well.
