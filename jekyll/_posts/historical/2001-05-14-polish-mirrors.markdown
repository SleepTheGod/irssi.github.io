There's two hosts now in pl.irssi.org, thanks jx and s- :) The second
one has CVS mirrored in pl.cvs.irssi.org, see [CVS
page](https://github.com/irssi) for more information if you wish to use
it. (the other pl www mirror has some problems currently, hopefully will
be fixed soon - yes, it's fixed now)

More CVS mirrors would be nice, contact me if you'd wish to provide one.
