Now that we finally have [archives](/historical/mailinglists), I think
i'll start using the mailing lists more :) So now's the time to
subscribe (or unsubscribe) them.

BTW. the new [theme
templates](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/blob/master/themes/default.theme)
code is in CVS now, maybe more themes will come as a result soon :)
