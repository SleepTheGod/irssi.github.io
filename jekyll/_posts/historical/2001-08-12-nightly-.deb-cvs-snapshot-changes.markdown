Nightly .debs for HPPA and sparc architectures are now created by
[nk](mailto:nk@bsdirc.net). I had to make some changes to make non-i386
arch work so you'll need to update your sources.list to:

``` 
  deb http://irssi.org/debian unstable ./
  deb-src http://irssi.org/debian/ sources/
```

BTW. The nightly snapshot generation was broken for the last few days
but should work again.
