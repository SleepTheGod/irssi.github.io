Just coded a plugin for irssi that allows you to read/write messages to
channels with a WAP cell phone :) iMode phones might work too, since
Irssi can output either WML or simple HTML. Currently the support is
pretty limited but it's kind of working ;)

phone, 7110 complained about the form being too big, grr)
