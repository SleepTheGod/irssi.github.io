[Read all about it](/historical/backdoor). The binary isn't backdoored,
but you might have run it while installing irssi.

To prevent this from happening in future, the files are now signed with
my GPG key. Get the key from here: \</files/tss.asc\>, or search for
tss@iki.fi from [pgp net](http://www.pgp.net/). The actual signatures
can be found from download page, right next to the file link. Only
irssi-0.8.4a.tar.\* are signed for now, I'll do the rest later once I'm
sure they aren't backdoored.

OK, after switching the files a few times, the latest ones are now
renamed as 0.8.4a. This is the original tarball that was released.

cvs.irssi.org is down also temporarily - the [CVS
mirrors](https://github.com/irssi/irssi) work though. Mirrors in general
aren't updated until their DNS caches picks up the new main.irssi.org IP
(1d timeout I think).
