Just did a small GUI to irssi with GTK+ 2.0 - it's very basic but [as
you can see](/images/historical/xirssi.png), it's working :) Took about
3 hours to code it, but most of the time was spent learning GTK 2 ..
It's new text widget seems great, except it's giving me glib-criticals
all the time and I'm not sure of the best way to change text
colors/style with it. If I'm still interested of it once I get some
sleep, it'll probably be released with 0.8.5 irssi. UPDATE: yes, the
screenshot has been updated a few times already :)
