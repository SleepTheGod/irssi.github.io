Released v0.7.12-2 :) Just a few bugfixes..

  - configure checks for -lnsl too
  - changed default font to fixed size so I wouldn't have to hear all
    the time how screen is messed up with zvt :)
  - background color couldn't be changed with zvt
  - irssi-text sometimes crashed at startup because of uninitialized
    variable..
  - you had to use \-\-without-gnome-panel even if you didn't build with
    gnome
