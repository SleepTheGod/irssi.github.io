I don't usually give away money, hopefully not this time either ;) I
really think irssi doesn't have any security related problems. Instead
of just telling myself that, here's a challenge for everyone to try find
them and win some money with it. See the [security challenge
page](/historical/challenge) for more information. Who knows if this
could be even used as publicity stunt to get more users and coders for
irssi ;)

Also I did a quick audit of my own and released Irssi 0.7.97.2. It
contains fixes for a few potential security bugs which shouldn't
practically happen ever: joining to \#../../../somefile with autologging
on, a few format bugs found (argh\! luckily only when printing nicks in
/names list and % is invalid nick char). Also the highascii control
characters aren't printed as-is to screen so those screen messing
problems are fixed now.
