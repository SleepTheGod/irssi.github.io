Just some advertising: **\#irssi** is now open in **ircnet**,
**openprojects** network and **efnet**. So just join there and you can
give me (cras) any suggestions, complains, etc.

And I don't think I'll continue with i2k anyway ;) Too much work, much
easier to do small fixes one at a time to Irssi but still go towards
i2k's functionality (or what I thought it would be :).

And my "Would Like To do" list for Irssi is now: Finish Perl support,
rewrite irssi text widget with one that takes as little memory as
possible but still is faster than ever and ability to have pics among
text. Replace notebook widget's tabs with something prettier, do split
windows to irssi-text and finally make a KDE version :)
