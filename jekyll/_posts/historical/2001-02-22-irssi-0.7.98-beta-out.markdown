Today's CVS snapshot: \</files/snapshots/irssi-20010222.tar.gz\> can
be considered as 0.7.98 beta. The final .98 is out probably later today
or tomorrow, so please try the beta soon and tell me if there's any
problems with it so I can fix them for the final release. **UPDATE:**
(13:12) /HILIGHT had some problems, fixed and repackaged new irssi.
