Hm.. Spent a week for coding new text widget for irssi. It finally
works, but the code is really horrible ;) And then I even noticed that
it couldn't handle bold fonts and it was a bit slow too, so .. I'll
start it all over again :) But now at least I know how to code gtk
widgets. At least somehow. And I really need to rewrite only one
function so it should be a day or two now that I've designed it well in
my head :) Anyway, it will support proportional fonts, graphics, etc.
nice things and should be really fast :) I'm quite busy at work also,
hopefully I get this itext widget to cvs this week :)

BTW, I've got **zero** bugreports about irssi 0.7.16\!\!
