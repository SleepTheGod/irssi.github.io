[Screenshot :)](/images/historical/silc.gif) - not that pretty yet but
we'll get there :)

SILC support is working great :) If you want to try, go get latest SILC
version from
http://silc.pspt.fi/.
You might want to use CVS version so you don't always have to patch the
silc sources when I change something :) Build the SILC, update irssi's
CVS tree and go to silc directory, run autogen.sh and do the rest as the
README file says.
