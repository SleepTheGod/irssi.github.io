Just though to mention, next irssi will have Perl support. There's
already some preliminary work in CVS. And I'm not very good with all
those C \<-\> Perl stuffs (or Perl even..) so any help would be nice :)
Anyway, here's a sample.pl that already works:

``` 
 
use Irssi;

sub myfunc {
        # $data = all arguments to /SAY, $server = current window's server
        my ($data, $server) = @_;

        $server->irc_send_cmd("PRIVMSG mynick :$data");
        return 1; # stops the /SAY from going to server
}
 
Irssi::signal_add("command say", "myfunc");
```
