Fixed the last important nasty bugs, added /STATUSBAR command, added
support for UTF-8.. That's pretty much it, I think. Only some
documentation updates and 0.7.99 is released then. So, treat the current
CVS snapshot as 0.7.99 beta and go test if there's still some problems
with it.

Here's the tarballs: \</files/snapshots/\> and [here's the upgrade
info](/historical/upgrade-cvs).
