As usual, a small nasty bug was left to 0.7.22.. Default configuration
file is invalid, you can fix it by adding comma at the end of the line 6
of file 'config' in irssi's main directory and recompiling/installing.
Or if you're lazy, you can get the new config here: \</files/config\>.
I also fixed it in the source tar.
