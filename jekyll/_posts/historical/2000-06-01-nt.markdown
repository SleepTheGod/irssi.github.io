I don't think I will release a working GTK/GNOME version of Irssi 0.8,
unless someone wants to help me with it. It hasn't been working for one
or two months now since the big rewrite. It's mostly just the windowing
system that needs to be rewritten, and I just don't have the interest to
make it work again.. However, I'm considering of starting KDE version.

Yesterday was the last day at my old job.
