title: "Irssi 1.2.3 Released"
---

Irssi 1.2.3 has been released! It contains a large number of fixes to
increase overall stability. There are no new features. **All Irssi 1.2
users should upgrade to this version**. See the [NEWS](/NEWS/#v1-2-3)
for details.

If you had previously applied the GLib patch this is now of course
included. Thanks to Zero King and Sergey Valentey for finding and
fixing memory issues. Credit to Oss-Fuzz for uncovering some
more. Apple users on ARM may thank Misty De MÃ©o for fixing some
peculiarities. Further contributions by Lauri Tirkkonen and Nutchanon
Wetchasit. Many thanks to the Irssi team as well for making this
release possible.

This release can be downloaded from [our releases page](/NEWS). Binary
test packages for various Linux distributions are automatically
generated by the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/)
and are available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

Work continues hard on Irssi 1.3 which you can test by compiling the
master branch from Git and help by testing Pull Requests or
contributing. However, there still remain some nuisances which we want
addressed before feeling comfortable to promote it to stable release.

The Irssi Team.
