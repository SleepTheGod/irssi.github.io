Irssi 1.2.1 and 1.1.3 and 1.0.8 have been released! They contain some
critical updates which we hope you'll enjoy. There are no new
features. **All Irssi users should upgrade to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#v1-2-1) for details.

For more information refer to the [security
advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2019_06).

If you've had any issues with SASL login suddenly failing, hopefully
this update will fix that.

This release can be downloaded from [our releases page](/NEWS). Binary
test packages for various Linux distributions are automatically
generated by the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/)
and are available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
and
[irssi-oldtest](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-oldtest;package=irssi)
repositories.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

The Irssi Team.
