[Joshua Dick](https://joshdick.net/) and [Sebastian
Pipping](https://www.hartwork.org/) have been putting our work into improving the
Irssi experience for Windows users. We made an installer built on NSIS and an
USB archive made to be put on an USB stick and allow carrying your personal
Irssi instance with you.

Welcome page.

Both packages offer running Irssi in two modes: either through cmd (the default
Windows command line) or puttycyg (a Putty-based command line) which mainly
looks better than cmd.
