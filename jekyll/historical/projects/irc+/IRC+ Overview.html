<h1>IRC+ Overview</h1>

<p>NOTE: I use the name IRC+ for this thing for now, it really should be
changed since there already exists ircplus.com, also
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529104315/http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/irc++/">irc++</a> is taken. Other
somewhat similiar projects include
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529104315/http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>
and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529104315/http://www.wwcn.org/">WWCN</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest reason I want this: I hate IRC networks, I just want to talk
to people, not figure out how to connect to yet another network.</p>

<h2>Basic Structure</h2>

<img src="IRC+%20Overview_files/irc.html">

<p>IRC+ servers are very much like SMTP servers. Everyone can run them, and
they connect directly to each other to send messages. Usually servers allow
only trusted clients (user/pass login, from specific IPs, ..) but there
could be several public servers as well. Users are identified by their
user@server address, very much like an email address.</p>

<p>Clients use normal IRC protocol to connect to IRC+ servers. Clients
never need more than one connection to the server, but servers may connect
to multiple other servers.</p>

<ul>
<li>john and david are joined to channels in ircnet and efnet</li>
<li>jane is joined to channels in ircnet</li>
</ul>

<p>Since IRC+ servers aren't directly connected to ircnet or efnet servers,
they need to create a new regular client connection for each user. So,
other people in ircnet would see john and jane as <em>john@irc+.isp.fi</em>
and <em>jane@irc+.isp.fi</em>, david would be seen as
<em>david@irc.example.com</em> - their nicks would default to same as user
but could be changed.</p>

<p>If john sends a private message to jane@irc+.isp.fi, it's sent directly
to her. If john sends a private message to david@irc+.example.com,
irc+.isp.fi connects to irc+.example.com, and sends the message to david.
The connection is left open for further communication until it's been idle
for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Users in ircnet and efnet are seen to you as <em>nick@ircnet</em> or
<em>nick@efnet</em>.</p>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<img src="IRC+%20Overview_files/ircchannel.html">

<p>Channels are located in one or more servers. Usually each channel
operator's server would be set as "channel server". Other users (or their
servers really) would then connect to any one of the channel servers to get
on the channel. Servers should have multiple connections between each
others (especially channel servers) so netsplits wouldn't happen so easily
(see if <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529104315/http://achurch.org/irc3/">IRC3 specs</a> could be
used).</p>

<p>So according to the pic above they'd join to
<em>#irssi@irc.irssi.org</em> or <em>#irssi@irc2.irssi.org</em>. Depending
on the channel settings, <em>#irssi@irc.private.org</em> could work as
well. Since john is a channel operator there, the default behaviour would
be to set irc.private.org as channel server for the time that john is an
operator there. But in our example, *.irssi.org would be the only allowed
channel servers.</p>

<p>All channel messages go to the channel servers, which then send the
messages to everyone else. Channel servers handle all the kicking etc. so
operators should trust them enough not to do any abusing. Anyway, if they
do notice that, they can just stop using that server and all will be well
again. If for some reason all channel servers go down, the other servers
may try to connect to each others and keep the channel together until they
can connect back to the real channel servers.</p>

<p>We probably also need to use digital signatures with all op-related
commands and each server would verify it before executing it. And in
general, servers should trust each other as little as possible.</p>

<h2>Router Network (optional)</h2>

<img src="IRC+%20Overview_files/ircrouters.html">

<p>They're very much like current IRC networks, except only servers connect
to them. <strong>Usage of them isn't required in any way</strong>, and
there may possibly be multiple router networks. Of course, the official
router network should be made good enough so there wouldn't be much point
in having alternative networks.</p>

<p>They exist for two purposes: make it easy to find information (channels
especially) and route the messages between servers when they can't connect
to each other directly (firewalls, temporary network breakage or just bad
connectivity).</p>

<h3>Locating Channels</h3>

<p>This is maybe their most important role. It's too difficult for normal
people to figure out which servers host the channel they want to join. The
channel operators may register their channel here, and advertise the
addresses for the channel servers. This way users can just <code>/JOIN
#channel</code> and their server would ask location of #channel from the
router servers, and connect there. If there's multiple registered
#channels, they could probably show a list of which the user can pick which
one to join. They'd also give the public keys for the channels, so servers
could be sure that they're joining to a valid server.</p>

<h3>Locating People?</h3>

<p>Maybe some people want to advertise themselves to others so they can
receive spam? :)</p>

<h3>Routing</h3>

<p>Router servers should have good network connections, so if a connection
breaks between two ISPs, other routes could still be used. Normal servers
may choose to communicate between each others either by directly, or
telling the router servers to send the message. By default, direct
connection would be tried first and router servers as a fallback. Channel
servers should be connected to each others both ways.</p>

<p>While it's not recommended to run servers inside NAT or firewall, router
servers would anyway allow sending messages to them whenever they're
connected to router network. This would be especially useful if you can't
find a good IRC+ server and otherwise couldn't run your own because your
ISP has firewalled/NATed you.</p>

<h3>..and we're back with the same old problems of IRC networks?</h3>

<p>Not really. Most annoying problem with different IRC networks is that
you need to connect to each network separately and that can be difficult
especially if you can't find a good server. It's also more difficult to
manage with many clients, and in general it's just not worth the trouble to
be connected in more than a few networks. With IRC+, it doesn't really
matter which router network you're connected to, if any. You can
<strong>always</strong> do <code>/MSG cras@irssi.org hello</code> and it
goes to me, or join to channels with <code>/JOIN
#irssi@irssi.org</code>. Router network only makes it possible for
<code>/JOIN #irssi</code> to work.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Router networks could also give the public keys of servers so other
servers can verify that no-one's doing man-in-the-middle attack. Also in
wishlist for future: distribute the public keys and irc+ servers' IP
addresses with DNS, similiar to MX fields.</p>

<h2>DoSsing</h2>

<p>I don't think DoS will be that much of a problem with IRC+. For killing
a channel, you'd need DoS each channel operator's server down, and even
then the other servers in channels might just connect to each other and
continue chatting without the chanops.</p>

<p>Servers of users in channel could also be hidden, so people couldn't be
DoSsed except by channel operators (unless of course they go and tell their
address). This however would prevent the possibility of non-channel servers
to connect to each other .. or maybe they could connect to each other
through the router network then? That would require servers to announce
which channels they've joined to the routers.</p>
