  <h2>Security Challenge</h2>

  <p>Problems found so far - too many, oh well, at least they're just
  crashes :) - 0.9 irssi hopefully will fix everything :)</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>0.7.98 - 0.8.0</strong> - remote crash</li>
    <li><strong>0.7.98.3</strong> - $ + hibit ascii character in topic
        crashed</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>temporarily frozen (2002-02-15)</strong> - since I'm currently
  very much out of money, I can't take the risk of someone actually finding
  any of these bugs :) This will be back in maybe around summer 2002 when I
  should have paid back most of my debts.</p>

  <p><strong>Challenge started: Tuesday, December 19 2000</strong></p>

  <p>I talk a lot about Irssi being secure. It having no buffer
  overflows, no remote exploits, nothing. So maybe instead of just
  bragging about it without any real security audits from other people, I
  thought once again about doing this challenge. Or actually I just
  mentioned about thinking it once in one IRC channel, and one guy said
  soon that he'd do it for a prize of $300. So I got excited about this
  again :)</p>

<h3>Prizes</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Security bug found when connected to any common ircd - $300</li>
  <li>Security bug found when connected to <strong>any</strong>
      ircd (patched as much as you like) - $100</li>
  <li>Remote crash found when connected to any common ircd - $50</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>I won't give more than one prize for security bug and one for remote
      crash. First people that send them win. One person can win both series.
      Same bug that causes both security breaks and crashes cannot win both
      series. If different people send such bug reports, the one who sent it
      first wins.</li>
  <li>This challenge may end at any time I announce so at this web site.</li>
  <li>Only latest released Irssi is valid.</li>
  <li>Plain irssi without any scripts or plugins loaded</li>
  <li>Settings must be reasonable, something that could be believable from a
      normal user with some brains. For example setting dcc download dir to
      /etc and running irssi as root doesn't count or some specially tweaked
      strange format string that would crash in certain conditions (although
      I don't think there's those either)</li>
  <li>Bugs caused by operating system or libraries don't count</li>
  <li>Some kind of demonstration is a must. Just something that I can find the
      bug and fix it. Maybe a small explanation or list of commands to send to
      irssi or pointing the error in sources</li>
  <li>Security bugs: these must let you to either run arbitrary code in the
      computer, or modify/create some unwanted file to your filesystem (no,
      dcc download dir, log dirs and config dirs don't count ;) or maybe some
      other security issues I can't currently think about.</li>
  <li>Remote crashes: Irssi has to be made crash remotely without any local
      user interaction. And it has to crash because server sent you something
      unexpected, not just that you noticed that irssi crashes because some
      rarely used setting is changed and irssi crashes every time with
      it.</li>
  <li>And finally, common sense should be used when reading these rules,
      figuring out some stupid loophole in my english is not acceptable ;)</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Common IRC daemons vs. others</h3>

  <p>There's a different prize given depending if the security bug is
  found when using irssi with commonly used IRC daemons than others.
  Commonly used daemons include only public IRC networks with thousands
  of users, like IRCNet, EFNet, DALNet and freenode.</p>

  <p>The reason for this? Most IRC clients only work securely with
  commonly used ircds. If for example the max. length of channel's
  password raises from 23 to, say, 100 a lot of IRC clients could be
  exploited through this. Using those clients to connect to unknown IRC
  servers could easily cause your box to get cracked. I believe Irssi
  doesn't suffer this problem, not as strongly as with common ircds
  though so the prize is smaller :)</p>

<h3>Things to check for in IRC clients</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Buffer overflows - "256 chars is enough for everybody forever".</li>
  <li>CTCPs - replying to them is done automatically, easy to cause 
      problems.</li>
  <li>DCC - <strong>lots</strong> of potential problems.</li>
  <li>Screen handling - some specific format combination might cause crashes.
      ANSI and MIRC colors may cause crashes when used "improperly".</li>
  <li>Executing external commands - especially when it's done automatically,
      and <strong>especially</strong> when it's executed through shell and
      with unchecked arbitrary parameters. Like some widely used IRC client
      did those only a few months ago.</li>
  </ul>
