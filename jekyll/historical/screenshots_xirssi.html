  <h2>xirssi screenshots</h2>

<p>Screenshot with latest changes. Tab labels show now all the channels that
are in that window - activity color is shown separately for each split
window. Active split window is shown with a red arrow. The "x ops, y total"
is moved inside nicklist. Topic has grey background when it's locked, it
usually is until you doubleclick it, after enter/esc it's locked again. The
menubar will be optional. Tab labels are now at bottom by default.. I think
they look better at top, but they're easier to access at bottom, especially
if other windows are on top of the upper part of xirssi.</p>

<img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots_xirssi_files/xirssi.png">

<p>When mouse is over a nick in window or nicklist, it's info is displayed
in statusbar. You can also right-click the nick to popup context menu. URLs
work the same way.</p>

<img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots_xirssi_files/xirssi-menu.png">

<p>When you have multiple channels in window (either /join -window, or split
windows) you'll get an "itemlist" which shows the active channel, and you
can use it to change the channel as well. If there's no active channels in
window, it shows list of servers. So, it works very much like Ctrl-X.</p>

<img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots_xirssi_files/xirssi-itemlist.png">

<p>Windows can be moved using drag and drop, very much like in Galeon. Tabs
can be reordered or detached, split windows can be detached as tabs or
new windows, tabs and split windows can be moved into other tabs as split
windows. Only thing still missing is easily reordering split windows. Above
I've started dragging #irssi tab into another window. Also notice the
indenting, %| works fine with GTK2's text widget :)</p>

<img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots_xirssi_files/xirssi-move.png">

<p>So far there's no IRC-specific code, so it can be used with
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050418053126/http://www.silcnet.org/">SILC</a> as well. Here you can also easily
see that names list is printed using monospace font. %# can be used in
formats to set monospace on/off.</p>
