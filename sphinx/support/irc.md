# Support on IRC

If you are stuck at any point, feel free to come to the IRC channel `#irssi` on the Libera Chat network and ask for assistance. To join, `/connect irc.libera.chat`, then `/join #irssi`.

When asking a question, make sure to stay around for a while and wait patiently, as the channel is all volunteer based and maybe noone is around or everyone is busy at the moment.

In case you need help getting Irssi to work, you can also use [the Libera Chat Webchat](https://web.libera.chat/#irssi).

Other networks may also have `#irssi` channels.
