# Support on IRC

If you are stuck at any point, feel free to come to the IRC channel `#irssi` on the Libera Chat network and ask for assistance. To join, `/connect irc.libera.chat`, then `/join #irssi`. While Irssi is not yet working, you can use [the Libera Chat Webchat](https://web.libera.chat/#irssi).

Other networks may also have `#irssi` channels.
